# registry.k8s.io



Kubernetes's multi-cloud image registry.



For more details on the design and implementation see the source repo: [https://github.com/kubernetes/registry.k8s.io](https://github.com/kubernetes/registry.k8s.io)



Most of the deployment configuration is in [infra/gcp/terraform/k8s-infra-oci-proxy](./../infra/gcp/terraform/k8s-infra-oci-proxy) (staging instance for development only) and [infra/gcp/terraform/k8s-infra-oci-proxy-prod](./../infra/gcp/terraform/k8s-infra-oci-proxy-prod) (production / end users).



# Managing Kubernetes container registries



This directory is for tools and things that are used to administer the GCR/AR

repositories used to publish official container images for Kubernetes.

## Staging repos



Kubernetes subprojects may use a dedicated staging GCP project to build and

host container images. We refer to the GCR provided by each staging project

as a staging repository. Images are promoted from staging repositories into

the main Kubernetes image registry (registry.k8s.io).



Access to each staging project is governed by a Google Group, which grants the

ability to manually trigger GCB or push container images in the event that

automated builds via something like prow.k8s.io are not setup or are broken.



### Requirements



The rule of thumb is that staging repositories should be used to host

artifacts produced by code that is part of the Kubernetes project, as defined

by presence in one of the [project-owned GitHub Organizations][project-github].



In other words, code that is not part of the Kubernetes project should not

have its artifacts hosted in staging repos. SIG K8s Infra may make exceptions

to this policy on a case-by-case basis.



For example:



- CRI-O is not part of the kubernetes project, it does not meet the

  requirements to get a staging repo

- While etcd and coredns are not part of the kubernetes project, we do

  bundle them with kubernetes as part of the release, so for this specific

  case are allowing a staging repo to host them (solely within the context

  of the kubernetes project)



### Creating staging repos



3. Add the project name to the `infra.staging.projects` list defined in

   [`infra/gcp/infra.yaml`][infra.yaml]



4. One your PR merges:

    - a postsubmit job will create the necessary google group

    - whoever approved your PR will run [the necessary bash script(s)][staging-bash]

      to create the staging repo



### Enabling automatic builds



Once your staging repo is up and running, you can enable automatic build and

push.  For more info, see [the instructions here][image-pushing-readme]



NOTE: All sub-projects are *strongly* encouraged to use this mechanism, though

it is not mandatory yet.  Over time this will become the primary way to build

and push images, and anything else will become exceptional.



### Creating image promoter manifests



1. Enable automatic builds and ensure and image has been published by Cloud Build

to the staging repo.



1. Create 3 files:

    - `images/k8s-staging-<project-name>/OWNERS`

    - `images/k8s-staging-<project-name>/images.yaml`

    - `manifests/k8s-staging-<project-name>/promoter-manifest.yaml`



The `promoter-manifest.yaml` file will house the credentials and other registry

metadata, whereas the `images.yaml` file will hold only the image data. You can

look at the existing staging repos for examples.



NOTE: For `images/k8s-staging-<project-name>/images.yaml`, it must not be empty as an image must be proposed

for promotion when you are opening this PR.



The separation between `promoter-manifest.yaml` and `images.yaml` is there to

prevent a single PR from modifying the source registry information as well as

the image information. Any changes to the `manifest/...` folder is expected to

be 1-time only during project setup.



Be sure to add the project owners to the

`images/k8s-staging-<project-name>/OWNERS` file to increase the number of

people who can approve new images for promotion for your project.



### Image Promoter



Image promotion roughly follows the following steps:



1. Push your image to one of the above staging docker repos

   e.g., gcr.io/k8s-staging-coredns

2. Fork this git repo

3. Add the image into the promoter manifest

   e.g., if you pushed gcr.io/k8s-staging-coredns/foo:1.3, then add a "foo"

   image entry into the manifest in `images/k8s-staging-coredns/images.yaml`

4. Create a PR to this git repo for your changes

5. The PR should trigger a `pull-k8sio-cip` job which will validate and dry-run

   your changes; check that the `k8s-ci-robot` responds 'Job succeeded' for it.

6. Merge the PR. Your image will be promoted by one of two jobs:

   - [`post-k8sio-image-promo`][post-promo-job] is a postsubmit that runs

     immediately after merge

   - [`ci-k8sio-cip`][ci-promo-job] is a periodic job that runs every four

     hours in case there are transient failures of the postsubmit jobs

7. Published images will be available at registry.k8s.io



We've written some tooling to simplify the creation of image promotion pull

requests, which is described in detail

[here](https://sigs.k8s.io/promo-tools/docs/promotion-pull-requests.md).
