We want to help!\n\n_ Check the {docs}/[reference documentation], especially the {docs}/how-to/index.html[How-to's] -- they provide solutions to the most common questions.\n* Learn the Spring basics -- Spring Boot builds on many other Spring projects; check the https://spring.io[spring.io] website for a wealth of reference documentation.\n&#x20; If you are new to Spring, try one of the https://spring.io/guides[guides].\n* If you are upgrading, read the {github}/wiki[release notes] for upgrade instructions and \"new and noteworthy\" features.\n* Ask a question -- we monitor https://stackoverflow.com[stackoverflow.com] for questions tagged with https://stackoverflow.com/tags/spring-boot[`spring-boot`].\n* Report bugs with Spring Boot at {github}/issues[github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues].\n\n\n\n== Reporting Issues\n\nSpring Boot uses GitHub's integrated issue tracking system to record bugs and feature requests.\nIf you want to raise an issue, please follow the recommendations below:\n\n* Before you log a bug, please search the {github}/issues[issue tracker] to see if someone has already reported the problem.\n* If the issue doesn't already exist, {github}/issues/new[create a new issue].\n* Please provide as much information as possible with the issue report.\nWe like to know the Spring Boot version, operating system, and JVM version you're using.\n* If you need to paste code or include a stack trace, use Markdown.\n+++```+++ escapes before and after your text.\n* If possible, try to create a test case or project that replicates the problem and attach it to the issue.\n\n\n\n== Building from Source\n\nYou don't need to build from source to use Spring Boot (binaries in https://repo.spring.io[repo.spring.io]), but if you want to try out the latest and greatest, Spring Boot can be built and published to your local Maven cache using the https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html[Gradle wrapper].\nYou also need JDK 17.\n\n[source,shell]\n---\n$ ./gradlew publishToMavenLocal\n---\n\nThis will build all of the jars and documentation and publish them to your local Maven cache.\nIt won't run any of the tests.\nIf you want to build everything, use the `build`task:\n\n[source,shell]\n----\n$ ./gradlew build\n----\n\n\n\n== Modules\n\nThere are several modules in Spring Boot. Here is a quick overview:\n\n\n\n=== spring-boot\n\nThe main library providing features that support the other parts of Spring Boot. These include:\n\n* The`SpringApplication`class, providing static convenience methods that can be used to write a stand-alone Spring Application.\n&#x20; Its sole job is to create and refresh an appropriate Spring`ApplicationContext`.\n* Embedded web applications with a choice of container (Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow).\n* First-class externalized configuration support.\n* Convenience `ApplicationContext`initializers, including support for sensible logging defaults.\n\n\n\n === spring-boot-autoconfigure\n\nSpring Boot can configure large parts of typical applications based on the content of their classpath.\nA single`@EnableAutoConfiguration`annotation triggers auto-configuration of the Spring context.\n\nAuto-configuration attempts to deduce which beans a user might need. For example, if`HSQLDB`is on the classpath, and the user has not configured any database connections, then they probably want an in-memory database to be defined.\nAuto-configuration will always back away as the user starts to define their own beans.\n\n\n\n=== spring-boot-starters\n\nStarters are a set of convenient dependency descriptors that you can include in your application.\nYou get a one-stop shop for all the Spring and related technology you need without having to hunt through sample code and copy-paste loads of dependency descriptors.\nFor example, if you want to get started using Spring and JPA for database access, include the`spring-boot-starter-data-jpa`dependency in your project, and you are good to go.\n\n\n\n=== spring-boot-actuator\n\nActuator endpoints let you monitor and interact with your application.\nSpring Boot Actuator provides the infrastructure required for actuator endpoints.\nIt contains annotation support for actuator endpoints.\nThis module provides many endpoints, including the`HealthEndpoint`, `EnvironmentEndpoint`, `BeansEndpoint`, and many more.\n\n\n\n=== spring-boot-actuator-autoconfigure\n\nThis provides auto-configuration for actuator endpoints based on the content of the classpath and a set of properties.\nFor instance, if Micrometer is on the classpath, it will auto-configure the `MetricsEndpoint`.\nIt contains configuration to expose endpoints over HTTP or JMX.\nJust like Spring Boot AutoConfigure, this will back away as the user starts to define their own beans.\n\n\n\n=== spring-boot-test\n\nThis module contains core items and annotations that can be helpful when testing your application.\n\n\n\n=== spring-boot-test-autoconfigure\n\nLike other Spring Boot auto-configuration modules, spring-boot-test-autoconfigure provides auto-configuration for tests based on the classpath.\nIt includes many annotations that can automatically configure a slice of your application that needs to be tested.\n\n\n\n=== spring-boot-loader\n\nSpring Boot Loader provides the secret sauce that allows you to build a single jar file that can be launched using `java -jar`.\nGenerally, you will not need to use `spring-boot-loader` directly but work with the link:spring-boot-project/spring-boot-tools/spring-boot-gradle-plugin[Gradle] or link:spring-boot-project/spring-boot-tools/spring-boot-maven-plugin[Maven] plugin instead.\n\n\n\n=== spring-boot-devtools\n\nThe spring-boot-devtools module provides additional development-time features, such as automatic restarts, for a smoother application development experience.\nDeveloper tools are automatically disabled when running a fully packaged application.\n\n\n\n== Guides\n\nThe https://spring.io/[spring.io] site contains several guides that show how to use Spring Boot step-by-step:\n\n* https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/[Building an Application with Spring Boot] is an introductory guide that shows you how to create an application, run it, and add some management services.\n* https://spring.io/guides/gs/actuator-service/[Building a RESTful Web Service with Spring Boot Actuator] is a guide to creating a REST web service and also shows how the server can be configured.\n\n\n\n== License\n\nSpring Boot is Open Source software released under the https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html[Apache 2.0 license]."
